MS student in Bioinformatics at Oregon Health & Science University.

## Background and Interests:
Working at the Maslen Lab studying Geneticically Triggered Aortic Aneurysms. 

- NGS Sequencing including Whole Exome sequencing, Targeted and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing 
- Genetically Triggered Aortopathy in Turner Syndrome.
- DNA methylation analysis and visualization. 


## Current Projects:

My current research interests are varied due to my ongoing studies. 
Some project stemmed out of final projects of coursework.
Others are pet projects to practice informatics. 
 
1) Thesis Project explores epigenetic alterations in DNA methylation related to Bicuspid Aortic Valve in Turner Syndrome.
2) Thesis Project includes bioinformatics analysis to characterized the newly released Illumina Methyl-Capture seq platform. 
3) Deep Learning Project: Predict Genes undergoing Genetic Compensation (w/ RNA-seq data) using DNA sequence information.
